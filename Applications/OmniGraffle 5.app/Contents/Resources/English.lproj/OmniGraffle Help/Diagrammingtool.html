This tool is especially fun if you have <a href="help:anchor='automaticlayout' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">automatic layout</a> turned on.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">If you have nothing selected, click any empty spot on the canvas to create a new generic shape there and select it.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Once you have a shape selected, click any empty spot on the canvas to create a new shape connected to the original one. Hold Option to create a sibling (connected to the same parent as the selected shape) instead. Hold Shift to add an aunt (essentially reversing the connection line of the new object), or hold Command to create a completely disconnected shape.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Click an existing shape to select it, so that you can use it as a starting point for creating more connected shapes.</span>                            </div>

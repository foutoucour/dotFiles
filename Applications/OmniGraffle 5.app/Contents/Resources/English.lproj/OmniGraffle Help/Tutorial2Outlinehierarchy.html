        <h2>Tutorial 2: Outline hierarchy</h2>
                            <div class="item "><span class="">It's nice that you can create shapes quickly from the keyboard like this, but the real magic is in adding depth to the outline. All of the characters you've created so far exist on the same level, but now let's add some more characters one level below them.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">The next two characters are soldiers who fought under Don Pedro's command, so we'll add them below him in the diagram. Click the Don Pedro item in the outline to select it, then press Return to create a new item below it. Name the new item &quot;Benedick&quot;.</span>                                <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/added fourth item.png" class="inline-image"></span>                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Now press the Tab key; Benedick in the outline becomes indented, and the corresponding shape on the canvas gets a connection line from Don Pedro. With Benedick still selected, press Return to create another item at the same level and name it &quot;Claudio&quot;. Now you have two characters that &quot;belong&quot; to Don Pedro.</span>                                <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/added two sub-items.png" class="inline-image"></span>                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Now use the same technique to add Beatrice and Hero underneath Leonato; they're his niece and his daughter. In the diagram, you'll see that they exist on the same level as Benedick and Claudio, but are connected to Leonato instead of Don Pedro.</span>                                <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/added two unrelated sub-items.png" class="inline-image"></span>                                </div>

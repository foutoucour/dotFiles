Use this command to check once right now. If there is an updated version of the software, you are prompted to download it.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Preferences</span> — Open OmniGraffle's preferences window; you can use it to customize the application's behavior to your liking.</span>                            </div>

OmniGraffle plays rather well with Mac OS X, so you should be able to use your standard services from within the application.</span>                            </div>

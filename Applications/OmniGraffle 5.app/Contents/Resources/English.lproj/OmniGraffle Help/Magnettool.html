                            <div class="item "><span class="">Magnets are special spots on a shape that attract <a href="help:anchor='connectionlines' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">connection lines</a>. If there are no magnets on a shape, all lines connect to the shape's center. If there is at least one magnet, each connected line is attracted to the nearest one. You can also connect lines directly to magnets, to make sure they stay connected to the same magnet regardless of how the shape is moved. Generally, the magnet position presets in the <a href="help:anchor='connectionsinspector' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">Connections inspector</a> should be good enough, but sometimes you might want to put magnets in very specific places on a shape.</span>                            </div>

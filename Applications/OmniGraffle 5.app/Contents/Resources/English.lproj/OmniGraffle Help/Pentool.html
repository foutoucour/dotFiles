We've included a lot of nice shapes in the <a href="help:anchor='linesandshapesinspector' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">Lines and Shapes inspector</a> and on the <a href="help:anchor='stencils' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">stencils</a>, but perhaps you would like to draw your own.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">To start a new shape, click anywhere on the canvas. Each subsequent click adds a new point to the shape, until you double-click or press Return to make the final point. At any point, instead of clicking, you can drag to create a point with bezier handles. While creating a shape, you can press Delete to remove the last point you added.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Bezier handles can define virtually any shape, once you get the hang of them. Each point can have a handle facing the next point, and a handle facing the previous point. The line between two points is defined by the first point's forward-facing handle and the second point's backward-facing handle. With no handles at all, you get a perfectly straight line. With handles, the line between them is a curve that tries to compromise between the handles' length and direction. This is truly one of those things that makes a ton more sense once you try it for yourself, so please do.</span>                                <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/Drawing bezier shape.png" class="inline-image"></span>                                </div>

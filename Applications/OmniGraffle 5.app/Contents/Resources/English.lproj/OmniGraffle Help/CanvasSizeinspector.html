        <h2><span class="Drop">Changing the canvas size and scale with the</span> Canvas Size inspector</h2>
                            <div class="item "><span class="">Use this inspector to change the size of the canvas, how the canvas fits onto printed pages, or what kind of measurement units to use.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">The <span class="UI">Canvas Size</span> fields control the width and height of the canvas. You can use any of the units available in the <a href="help:anchor='ruler' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">Ruler</a>, or enter a number of pages.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Select <span class="UI">Size is multiple of printer sheets</span> to make the edges of the canvas snap to the edges of pages. This prevents the canvas from ending in the middle of a page.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">If you select <span class="UI">Auto-adjust the canvas size</span>, the canvas will grow or shrink to fit the objects you create.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">When you print, if <span class="UI">Print canvas on one printer sheet</span> is selected, the canvas gets scaled up or down to fit a single piece of paper regardless of its size on the screen.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">The <span class="UI">Orientation</span> of pages can be portrait (vertical), landscape (horizontal), or can be taken from the settings in <a href="help:anchor='pagesetup' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">Page Setup</a>.</span>                            </div>

All of OmniGraffle's supported units are listed, with their standard abbreviations.</span>                                </div>
                                <div class="item "><span class="">The actual size of your diagram does not change when you change the units; it is merely measured differently. The ruler and the inspectors display measurements in whichever unit you select here.</span>                                </div>
                                <div class="item "><span class="">Units marked with an asterisk (*) can be used as canvas units. This means that when you set up a unit scale (see below), only these units can be used on the left-side &quot;actual size&quot; part of the equation. Any kind of units can be used on the right-side &quot;theoretical size&quot; part of the scale equation.</span>                                </div>

                            <div class="item Pro"><span class="Bold">Unit Scale</span>                                <div class="item "><span class="">The <span class="UI">Unit scale</span> control can interpret simple expressions of scale. Several useful scales, such as <span class="UI">1 in = 1 ft</span>, are available, and you can also enter your own scale by choosing <span class="UI">Custom</span>.</span>                                </div>
                                <div class="item "><span class="">For example, say you enter <span class="Verbatim">1 cm = 1 m</span>. What was 1 centimeter on the ruler now becomes 1 meter, objects on the canvas that were 2 centimeters wide now become 2 meters wide, and so on. The units setting changes to match the second value in the equation.</span>                                </div>
                                <div class="item "><span class="">You can also enter a ratio. Imagine that you enter <span class="Verbatim">1:12</span>. The ruler units stay the same, but objects on the canvas now claim to be 12 times larger than they were before you changed the scale.</span>                                </div>
                                <div class="item "><span class="">To change the scale back to normal and treat the ruler and objects as &quot;actual size&quot;, select <span class="UI">Reset Scale</span> from the <span class="UI">Unit scale</span> pop-up menu.</span>                                </div>
                                <div class="item "><span class="">If you already have a scale set up and you conver directly to a different one, the objects change their actual size on the canvas to fit the new scale. For example, imagine you are working in <span class="Verbatim">1 cm = 1 m</span>, and then you convert the scale to <span class="Verbatim">2 cm = 1 m</span>. The marks on the ruler become twice as far apart as they were, and the objects on the canvas, staying true to the ruler, grow twice as large on the screen. You can get a new scale without resizing the objects by choosing from the <span class="UI">Reset Scale To:</span> section of the Unit scale pop-up menu. </span>                                </div>

<a name="origin"></a>
                            <div class="item "><span class="">By default, the very upper-left corner of a canvas is its origin (that is, the point where the rulers' measurements start from, where the coordinates are 0,0). To change the origin, enter values in the two <span class="UI">Origin</span> fields. (You can also drag the origin from the corner where the <a href="help:anchor='rulers' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">rulers</a> meet.) The coordinates in the <a href="help:anchor='geometryinspector' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">Geometry inspector</a> are based on this origin point.</span>                            </div>

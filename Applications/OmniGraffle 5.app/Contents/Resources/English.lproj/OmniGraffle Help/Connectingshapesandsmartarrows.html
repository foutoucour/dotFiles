Drag one of these handles to another object to make a connection. The shape stretches and reorients to stay connected just like a line, but can have a shape and a fill just like a shape.

When you resize an arrow shape, it tries to keep its arrowheads the same size, rather than stretching them along with the rest of the shape. If you want to change the size of the arrowheads or the thickness of the stem, click the blue handle in the crook of the arrowhead and drag.</span>                                </div>

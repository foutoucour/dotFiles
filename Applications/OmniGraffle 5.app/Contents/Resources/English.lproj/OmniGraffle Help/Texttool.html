        <h2><span class="Drop">Creating and editing text with the</span> Text tool</h2>
                            <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/Text.png" class="inline-image"> Use the text tool to add a label to an object, to edit the label on an object, or to create a new <a href="help:anchor='shape' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">shape</a> with text inside.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/using text tool.png" class="inline-image"></span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Click a shape to start editing its text. While you are in text editing mode, the top <a href="help:anchor='ruler' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">ruler</a> becomes a text ruler, and you can use standard Mac OS X text editing commands (for example, you can use the arrow keys to move the insertion point around).</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Click or drag in an empty area of the canvas to create a new <a href="help:anchor='shape' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">shape</a> with settings particularly suited to containing text. A single click creates an object that expands horizontally to fit the text you enter; a drag creates an object of a specific width. Remember that the objects you create in this way are not fundamentally different from other shapes; they just start with certain settings in the <a href="help:anchor='textinspector' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">Text inspector</a> which make them convenient for containing text.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Click a connection line to add a new label to it. This label is just like the object created when you click an empty area of the canvas, except it is attached as a <a href="help:anchor='linelabel' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">line label</a>.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Text inside objects can be found by Mac OS X's Spotlight search feature, in case you need to find your OmniGraffle diagrams that contain certain words.</span>                            </div>

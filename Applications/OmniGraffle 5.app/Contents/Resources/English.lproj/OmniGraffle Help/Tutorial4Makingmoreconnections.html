        <h2>Tutorial 4: Making more connections</h2>
                            <div class="item "><span class="">You've already got a fine diagram, but sometimes you want to diagram relationships that are not strictly tree-like. Let's manually add some more connections. Before you start connecting things together yourself, it's a good idea to turn off the automatic layout feature. Choose <span class="UI">Diagram Layout</span> from the <span class="UI">Inspectors</span> menu to show the relevant inspector, then deselect the <span class="UI">Automatic Layout</span> checkbox.</span>                                <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/turn off auto layout.png" class="inline-image"></span>                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Now let's make the Line tool match the lines already on the canvas. Click and hold the Line tool button in the tool palette, and a menu appears. Under <span class="UI">Canvas Styles</span>, select the <span class="UI">Straight, Stroke: Obsidian</span> entry. Now the lines you make with the Line tool will look the same as the lines that were created automatically by the outline view.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">To connect two shapes, just activate the Line tool, click one shape, then click the other shape. Make connections and label them to signify the following relationships: Don John and Don Pedro are half-brothers; Don Pedro and Leonato are friends; Hero and Claudio are in love; Benedick and Beatrice are (eventually) in love. As you do this, free to use the Selection tool to move shapes into more comfortable locations.</span>                                <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/structurally complete diagram.png" class="inline-image"></span>                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Now that the diagram is more complicated than a simple outline, you won't be needing the outline view any more. Choose <span class="UI">Outline</span> from the <span class="UI">View</span> menu again to hide it, or just click its icon in the toolbar.</span>                            </div>

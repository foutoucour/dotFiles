        <h2>Tutorial 1: Creating objects with the outline view</h2>
                            <div class="item "><span class="">The Drawing Basics section taught you how to <a href="help:anchor='createshapes' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">create shapes</a> and <a href="help:anchor='connectobjectswithlines' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">connect objects with lines</a>. But there's another clever way to enter data: the outline sidebar. If you've ever used an outliner (say, OmniOutliner, a fine product indeed), this should be familiar to you. If not, you'll probably pick it up easily anyway.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Because you chose the Basic template, the outline sidebar is already visible to the left of the main canvas area. Click the blue outline area to create your first item. An item called &quot;Topic&quot; appears in the outline, and simultaneously a shape labeled &quot;Topic&quot; appears on the canvas.</span>                                <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/outline created item.png" class="inline-image"></span>                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">The item's text is already highlighted, so you can just start typing to rename it. This item represents our first character, so type &quot;Don John&quot;.</span>                                <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/typed name in outline.png" class="inline-image"></span>                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Press Return to finish with this item and move on to the next one. A new item appears below the first one in the outline, and a new shape appears on the canvas. Name this one &quot;Don Pedro&quot;.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Press Return once more to create a third item, and name it &quot;Leonato&quot;. Now you have three items in your outline and three shapes on your canvas.</span>                                <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/typed three names in outline.png" class="inline-image"></span>                                </div>

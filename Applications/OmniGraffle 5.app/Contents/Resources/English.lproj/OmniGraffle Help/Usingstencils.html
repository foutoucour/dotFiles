                        <div class="item "><span class="">A stencil is a set of useful objects that you can drag into your own diagrams. To see your stencils, select <span class="UI">Stencils</span> from the <span class="UI">Window</span> menu.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/Stencil viewer.png" class="inline-image"></span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/dot1.png" class="inline-image"> Click these buttons to see the objects as they appear on the stencil or separated out with each in its own box.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/dot2.png" class="inline-image"> Use the Action pop-up menu to edit stencils, customize the stencils list, or create new stencils; see more about these commands below.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/dot3.png" class="inline-image"> Type something in the search field to find stencils whose names match, or stencils containing objects whose text or notes match. You can even search online to find stencils other people have made. See below for more about stencil searching.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/dot4.png" class="inline-image"> Select a stencil in the list to see its contents; select a whole folder to see the contents of all the stencils inside.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/dot5.png" class="inline-image"> The stencils you select appear here; drag objects from here to your document. If you have opened a stencil that isn't yet installed, click the Install button that appears in the title bar to copy it into your home folder for safekeeping.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/dot6.png" class="inline-image"> When you select an object, some information about it, including any <a href="help:anchor='notes' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">notes</a> or <a href="help:anchor='customdata' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">custom data</a> it may have, appears here in the metadata pane.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/dot7.png" class="inline-image"> If you don't want a whole object, but just one or all of its styles, drag a style from the <a href="help:anchor='styletray' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">style tray</a> to an object in your document.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/dot8.png" class="inline-image"> Click this button to show or hide the metadata pane.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">To put an object on the canvas, just drag it from the stencil and drop it wherever you like. A copy of the object is made and the original remains on the stencil, so take as many copies as you need. You can do the same sort of selection tricks that you can do on a canvas, like Command-clicking or dragging a rectangle to select multiple objects.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">The stencil list is divided into several sections.</span>                            <div class="item "><span class="">Your <span class="UI">Stencil Library</span> includes all of the stencils you have installed, whether they're built in to OmniGraffle or in an <a href="help:anchor='applicationsupport' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">Application Support</a> folder.</span>                            </div>
                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="UI">Recent Stencils</span> lists the last five stencils you looked at. If you open a not-yet-installed stencil, it appears in the recent list; you can click the <span class="UI">Install</span> button near its title to copy it to the right location in your Home folder.</span>                            </div>
                            <div class="item "><span class="">The <span class="UI">Favorite Stencils</span> section is fully customizable. You can drag any installed stencils you like into it. Choose <span class="UI">New Favorite Stencil Folder</span> from the Action pop-up menu to create a folder for organizing your favorites.</span>                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">To search your stencils, type in the search field above the stencil list. OmniGraffle searches your stencils' titles, the text of the objects on each stencil, and the notes and custom data. Stencils that match appear in the special <span class="UI">Search Results</span> section of the stencil list. Normally, if any object on a stencil matches, then all objects on that stencil appear in the results. But if you turn on the <span class="UI">Filter</span> setting in the seach field's pop-up menu, then objects that don't match what you typed disappear.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">To search the online OmniGraffle stencil repository, click the search field's pop-up menu and choose <span class="UI">Graffletopia</span>. This is Patrick Crowley's free service, where anyone can share useful stencils. When you search Graffletopia, stencils whose names or descriptions match appear in the <span class="UI">Search Results</span> list. Click a stencil to see a preview and a description, then click the <span class="UI">Download</span> button to get a copy for yourself. Open the file that appears in Finder, and then you can use or install the stencil normally. You can also visit Graffletopia from OmniGraffle's <span class="UI">Help</span> menu, or by going to <a href="http://graffletopia.com/">http://graffletopia.com</a>.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">To make a new stencil, choose <span class="UI">New Resource ▸ Stencil</span> from the <span class="UI">File</span> menu. You can edit the document that appears just like you would edit a normal OmniGraffle diagram. A preview of the stencil appears in the stencil window as you work. Once the stencil looks just how you want it, choose <span class="UI">Save</span> from the <span class="UI">File</span> menu; the default location for saving is the <a href="help:anchor='applicationsupport' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">Application Support</a> folder inside your Library.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">To edit a stencil, select it in the list and then choose <span class="UI">Edit Stencil</span> (or <span class="UI">Copy and Edit Stencil</span>, if it's built-in) from the Action pop-up menu above. Then edit and save the stencil just like a normal OmniGraffle document.</span>                        </div>

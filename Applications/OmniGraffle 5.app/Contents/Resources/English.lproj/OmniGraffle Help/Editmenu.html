When you finish editing the text, the tag changes to represent some aspect of the object itself, the canvas, the page, or the document. If the data that the tag refers to changes, the tag automatically updates itself. Some variables, like Page Number, are useful for putting on a <a href="help:anchor='sharedlayer' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">shared layer</a> and then sharing that layer with every canvas.</span>                                </div>

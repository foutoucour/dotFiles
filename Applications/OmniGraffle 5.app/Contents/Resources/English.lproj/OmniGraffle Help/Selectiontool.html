Click a control point to select it; if a control point is hiding behind a selection handle, Option-Command-click to select it, or just select a different control point first to make the handles go away. If a control point has bezier handles, they appear when you select the point. Drag either of the two handles to adjust both, or Option-drag to adjust them one at a time. Shift-drag to constrain the handle's angle to 45-degree increments. Command-drag a point to give it handles.

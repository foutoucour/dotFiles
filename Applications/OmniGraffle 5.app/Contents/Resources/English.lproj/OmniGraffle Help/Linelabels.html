        <h2>Line labels</h2>
                            <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/line label.png" class="inline-image"></span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">A line label is a shape object that has been attached to a line.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">When you click a <a href="help:anchor='connectionline' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">connection line</a> with the <a href="help:anchor='texttool' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">Text tool</a>, a line label is created. But this is not the only way to create one. Any <a href="help:anchor='shape' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">shape</a> object can become a line label; drag a shape to a line and drop it there when the line becomes highlighted. This works only if the line is set in the <a href="help:anchor='connectionsinspector' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">Connections inspector</a> to allow labels. A line label can be removed by dragging it away from the line.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">A line label stays attached to its line until you remove it; this means you can move or reroute the line without losing the labels.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">You can change the position and orientation of a line label with the <a href="help:anchor='geometryinspector' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">Geometry inspector</a>. You can also press the arrow keys to adjust the location and offset of the selected line label; note that the Right arrow always means &quot;toward the head of the line&quot;, regardless of whether the line is pointing to the right or not.</span>                            </div>

        <h2><span class="Drop">Setting up a grid with the</span> Grid inspector</h2>
                            <div class="item "><span class="">Use this inspector to set up a grid on the canvas, so you can keep objects lined up nicely.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">The <span class="UI">Major Grid Spacing</span> field determines how large each square of the main grid should be. Click the color well next to it to choose a color for the major grid.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">The <span class="UI">Minor Grid Steps </span>field determines how many minor grid squares should fit across one major grid square. For example, if your major grid squares are 100 pixels across, and you have 10 minor grid steps, your minor grid squares are 10 pixels across. Click the color well next to it to choose a color for the minor grid.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">While the <span class="UI">Snap to grid</span> checkbox is selected, all objects fit themselves to the grid as you create or move them. (If you want to snap objects already on the canvas, use the <span class="UI">Align To Grid</span> button below.)</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Select <span class="UI">Grid in front</span> to make the grid visible in front of objects on the canvas.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Select <span class="UI">Print grid</span> to include the grid when printing.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Select <span class="UI">Show grid</span> to make the minor grid visible, and <span class="UI">Show major</span> to make the major grid visible as well.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">The controls below the separator affect the currently selected objects. The <span class="UI">Center on grid</span> and <span class="UI">Edges on grid</span> buttons determine whether the center point of the object or the object's edges should align to the grid. Click the <span class="UI">Align To Grid</span> button to make all of the selected objects line up to the grid right away.</span>                            </div>

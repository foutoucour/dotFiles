        <h2>Drawing on layers</h2>
                            <div class="item "><span class="">The layers of a canvas are listed in the canvases sidebar. To open it, select <span class="UI">Canvases</span> from the <span class="UI">View</span> menu or click the <span class="UI">Canvases</span> <a href="help:anchor='toolbar' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">toolbar</a> button.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Click the disclosure triangle next to a <a href="help:anchor='canvas' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">canvas</a> to see its layers. Layers are transparent, so behind the top layer's contents you see the second layer's contents, and so on to the contents of the bottom layer.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Each layer in the list has a small preview of its contents, a title, and when you put the mouse pointer over it, three icons. The layer you are currently editing has a pencil icon <img src="../../HelpImages/Layers-Pen.png" class="inline-image"> to its left. To edit a different layer, click just to the left of its preview and the pencil icon moves there.</span>                            </div>

<a name="lockedlayers"></a>
                            <div class="item "><span class="">To make a layer visible or invisible, click its eye icon <img src="../../HelpImages/TinyVisible.png" class="inline-image">. To set whether a layer appears when the canvas is printed, click its printer icon <img src="../../HelpImages/TinyPrint.png" class="inline-image">. To lock or unlock a layer, click its padlock icon <img src="../../HelpImages/TinyLock.png" class="inline-image">. Locking a layer prevents its contents from being changed.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">You can rearrange layers by dragging them in the list. You can also drag a layer to move a it to a different canvas; Option-drag to copy it instead. If you drag it to a completely different document, it will always be copied there.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">To add a new layer click the new layer button at the bottom of the canvases drawer.</span>                                <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/New layer button.png" class="inline-image"></span>                                </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">To delete a layer, select it and then press the Delete key or choose <span class="UI">Delete Layer</span> from the Action pop-up menu at the bottom of the sidebar. Any canvas needs at least one layer, so you can't delete the last one.</span>                            </div>

        <h2><span class="Drop">Using</span> diagram styles</h2>
                        <div class="item "><span class="">Diagram styles are OmniGraffle documents that define an appearance you can apply to an outline or a diagram. There are infinite ways to represent the same data; a diagram style helps you indicate just how you want the data to be represented.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">The main situations when diagram styles come in handy are when you write an outline with OmniGraffle's <a href="help:anchor='outlineview' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">outline view</a> (using the <span class="UI">Choose Diagram Style</span> command in the <span class="UI">Format</span> menu) or when you <a href="help:anchor='import' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">import</a> an OmniOutliner file (using the importing dialog). In these situations, the diagram style translates text items into visible objects. Several diagram styles come with OmniGraffle; try using the outline view with various diagram styles to see their effects.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">When you apply a diagram style, the items of the outline are styles to match the diagram style's <a href="help:anchor='shapes' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">shapes</a>, <a href="help:anchor='connectionlines' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">connection lines</a>, and <a href="help:anchor='automaticlayout' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">automatic layout</a> settings. Items at each level of the outline become shape objects matching objects at the same level of the diagram. If the outline has more levels than the diagram style, the deeper items use the styles of the deepest level of the diagram style.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">To create your own diagram style, choose <span class="UI">New Resource ▸ New Diagram Style</span> from the <span class="UI">File</span> menu, then choose a template to begin from. Set up a one-canvas, one-layer diagram containing some interconnected objects, styled the way you want. A diagram style should be a strictly tree-like structure; this means the connection lines should create a hierarchy without doubling back on themselves. When you're ready, save it. The default save location is inside your own <a href="help:anchor='applicationsupport' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">Application Support</a> folder, where OmniGraffle looks for your diagram styles. Once a template is saved in that location, it becomes available in the diagram style chooser.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">If you intend to import OmniOutliner files with multiple columns, you can create a diagram style with a group of shapes, rather than a single shape, to represent each item. In this case, you should put a text label on each object so that you can associate columns with them when opening the OmniOutliner file.</span>                        </div>

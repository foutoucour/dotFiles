        <h2><span class="Drop">Automatically arranging objects with the Diagram </span>Layout inspector</h2>
                            <div class="item "><span class="">Use this inspector to automatically lay out <a href="help:anchor='shapes' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">shapes</a> based on the logical relationships established by the <a href="help:anchor='connectionlines' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">connection lines</a> between them.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Select the <span class="UI">Automatic layout</span> checkbox to make OmniGraffle lay out the objects on the canvas whenever the connections between them change.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Four <span class="Bold">layout type</span> buttons indicate the four methods OmniGraffle can use to lay out the diagram. The <span class="Bold">hierarchical</span> layout creates layers of equally-ranked objects, extending in one direction. The <span class="Bold">force-directed</span> layout grows in semi-random directions from the center, rather than in one particular direction from the edge. The <span class="Bold">circular</span> layout tries to arrange sibling shapes in a circle around their parent. The <span class="Bold">radial</span> layout tries to arrange sibling shapes in arcs around their parent.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">When you use a hierarchical layout:</span>                                <div class="item "><span class="">The <span class="UI">Direction</span> buttons change where the top level objects start, and which way to layer the lower level objects from there.</span>                                </div>
                                <div class="item "><span class="">The <span class="UI">Rank Separation</span> field controls how far away each level of objects should be from the next.</span>                                </div>
                                <div class="item "><span class="">The <span class="UI">Object Separation</span> field controls how far away each object should be from other objects on the same level.</span>                                </div>
                                <div class="item "><span class="">Use the <span class="UI">Selected Object Rank</span> buttons to assign a hierarchical rank to the selected objects. <span class="UI">Default</span> lets OmniGraffle decide the rank based on connections, <span class="UI">Minimum</span> puts the objects at the top of the hierarchy, <span class="UI">Maximum</span> puts the objects at the bottom of the hierarchy, and <span class="UI">Same</span> makes sure that the objects end up on the same level. These assignments don't change the directions of connection lines, so you can always select all of your objects and choose <span class="UI">Default</span> to return them to normal.</span>                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">When you use other layout methods:</span>                                <div class="item "><span class="">Connection lines can stretch and compress, but you can adjust their average length by dragging the <span class="UI">Line Length</span> slider.</span>                                </div>
                                <div class="item "><span class="">In a force-directed layout, you can select individual lines and then click the <span class="UI">Custom length</span> checkbox to adjust them separately from the rest of the lines.</span>                                </div>
                                <div class="item "><span class="">The <span class="UI">Shape Repulsion</span> slider determines how strongly the shapes try to avoid coming near one another. If the line length and shape repulsion are small enough, shapes can be made to overlap.</span>                                </div>

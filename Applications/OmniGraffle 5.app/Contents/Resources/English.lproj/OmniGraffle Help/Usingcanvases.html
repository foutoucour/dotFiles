                            <div class="item "><span class="">The canvas is your work area, where you create, edit, and move objects. Any document contains at least one canvas, and you can create as many as you like (and thus have as many separate work areas as you like) in the same document.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="Bold">The Canvases sidebar</span>                                <div class="item "><span class="">The canvases in your document are listed in the canvases sidebar. To open it, select <span class="UI">Canvases</span> from the <span class="UI">View</span> menu or click the <span class="UI">Canvases</span> <a href="help:anchor='toolbar' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">toolbar</a> button. Each canvas has a title, a disclosure triangle for showing its <a href="help:anchor='layers' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">layers</a>, and a preview image.</span>                                </div>
                                <div class="item "><span class="">To select a canvas, click its name or preview. The canvas appears in the document window, where you can add and edit objects.</span>                                </div>
                                <div class="item "><span class="">To rename a canvas, double-click its name in the sidebar.</span>                                </div>

                                <div class="item "><span class="">To change the style attributes of a canvas, first click its preview in the sidebar; it becomes highlighted in color rather than in gray to show that you are now working in the sidebar rather than the main canvas area. While the canvas is highlighted in color, use the <a href="help:anchor='fillinspector' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">Fill inspector</a>, <a href="help:anchor='linesandshapesinspector' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">Lines and Shapes inspector</a>, and <a href="help:anchor='imageinspector' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">Image inspector</a> to change its style.</span>                                </div>

        <h2><span class="Drop">Positioning objects neatly with the</span> Alignment inspector</h2>
                            <div class="item "><span class="">Use this inspector to line up and space out objects uniformly.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">The <span class="Bold">matrix</span> of nine buttons on the left changes how the alignment buttons work. It represents all of the combinations between vertically aligning to the top, middle, or bottom, and horizontally aligning to the left, center, or right. If you want, for example, to align objects by their upper-right corners, click the upper-right button in the matrix.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Next to the button matrix are the <span class="Bold">align buttons</span>. Their icons change to reflect the state of the button matrix. Click the horizontal-align button to line up the selected objects horizontally. Click the vertical-align button to line up the selected objects vertically. The first object you selected stays where it is, and the other selected objects move to align with it. These buttons are only useful when you have at least two objects selected.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Next to the align buttons are two <span class="Bold">spread buttons</span>. Click the horizontal spread button to distribute the selected objects evenly between the leftmost and rightmost objects. Click the vertical spread button to distribute the selected objects evenly between the top and bottom objects. These buttons are only useful when you have at least three objects selected.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">To the right are two<span class="Bold"> </span>fields and their associated <span class="Bold">spacing buttons</span>. Enter a value in the top field and click the horizontal spacing button to put the specified amount of horizontal space between the selected objects. Enter a value in the bottom field and click the vertical spacing button to put the specified amount of vertical space between the selected objects. These buttons are only useful if you have at least two objects selected.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">If <span class="UI">Align to canvas</span> is selected, the align and spread buttons consider the canvas edges as &quot;objects&quot; when arranging the selected objects. This makes it so that you can align objects to a canvas edge, or space objects evenly between the canvas edges.</span>                            </div>

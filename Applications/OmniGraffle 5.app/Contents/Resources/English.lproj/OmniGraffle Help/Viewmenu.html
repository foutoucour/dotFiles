                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Proof Setup </span>— Use this submenu to set a printing or proofing device and its assigned profile. The default proofing profile is the Mac OS X default proof profile (usually &quot;Generic CMYK Profile&quot;), but you can use the profile of any printing or proofing device available on your system.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Proof Colors</span> — Turn on soft proofing, using the device set in the <span class="UI">Proof Setup</span> submenu. This adds an extra step to the display path for images and colors. First each color is converted from the appropriate one of the three document profiles to the proofing profile, then from the proofing profile to the display profile. This theoretically lets you see on screen what your printed output will look like, since it duplicates the printing path in Mac OS X. This does greatly depend upon the quality of the color profile of your printer, though. For many consumer ink jets, for instance, the printer profile claims that it can reproduce any color (as a way to avoid ColorSync and substitute their own color enhancement in the printer driver). For these printers, soft proofing may not visibly change anything.</span>                            </div>

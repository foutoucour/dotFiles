        <h2><span class="Drop">Controlling document-wide settings in the</span> Document inspector</h2>
                            <div class="item "><span class="">The pop-up menu under <span class="UI">File format options</span> determines whether to save your document as a <span class="Bold UI">flat file</span><span class="Bold"> </span>or a <span class="UI">file package</span>. A flat file is a single file on the disk, with all of the attached images embedded in it. A file package is actually a folder disguised as a single file, with all of the attached images rattling around loose inside. In some technical cases, it might be desirable to use one type or the other; if you don't even know why this should matter, it's safe to stick with the <span class="UI">Automatic</span> setting.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Normally OmniGraffle documents are &quot;property list&quot;–based text files. If the <span class="UI">Compress on disk</span> checkbox is selected, your file is instead saved in a binary format that takes up less space on the disk but whose innards can't be read by scripts or text editor applications. If you don't have any idea why someone would want to open up their OmniGraffle documents with a text editor, go ahead and compress your files.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">You can specify page margins, or just choose to use the <span class="UI">Printer margins</span> as defined by your printer driver (or by your custom <a href="help:anchor='pagesetup' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">Page Setup</a> settings).</span>                            </div>

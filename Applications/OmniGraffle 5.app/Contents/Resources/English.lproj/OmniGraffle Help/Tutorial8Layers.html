        <h2>Tutorial 8: Layers</h2>
                            <div class="item "><span class="">Layers contain different sets of objects on the same canvas. We'll put our background image on a new layer to keep it separate from the character diagram.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Click the Canvases button in the toolbar to see the canvases sidebar. It contains the one canvas you have so far; click the disclosure triangle next to it to see its layers.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">You only have one layer right now, so we'll add another one. Click the Add Layer button <img src="../../HelpImages/add layer button.png" class="inline-image"> below the sidebar. A new layer is born. You can name it if you like; something like &quot;Background&quot; should suffice.</span>                                <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/added layer.png" class="inline-image"></span>                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">The order of layers is important; stuff on higher layers appears in front of stuff on lower layers. We want the background to appear behind our relationships diagram, so drag the new layer and drop it below the other one in the list.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Let's concentrate on the background layer. The layer you're working with right now has a pencil icon to the left of its preview in the drawer. If the background layer doesn't have the pencil icon, click just to the left of the layer preview to put it there.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">For your background, find a nice image on one of your disks (or download one from the Web). Drag the image file from the Finder and drop it on a blank area of the canvas. A new shape containing the image is created on the background layer.</span>                                <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/dropping image file.png" class="inline-image"></span>                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Drag the selection handles on the corners of the shape to stretch it to a nice big size; hold Shift as you drag to keep the image from getting distorted. Then use the Image inspector to set the image's opacity to about <span class="Verbatim">15%</span>.</span>                                <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/adjusted image.png" class="inline-image"></span>                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Now you have an attractive, informative diagram. You know how to use the outline view to create objects, how to label and connect them, and how to add styles. You know how to propagate styles around to many objects. You know how to use multiple layers. At this point, you're pretty much unstoppable!</span>                            </div>

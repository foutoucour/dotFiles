        <h2>ColorSync support</h2>
                        <div class="item "><span class="">OmniGraffle Professional supports Apple's ColorSync technology, which tries to keep colors as accurate as possible when viewed on any ColorSync-compliant display and when printed on any ColorSync-compliant printer.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">ColorSync is OmniGraffle's fourth preference pane; you can get to it by choosing <span class="UI">Preferences</span> from the <span class="UI">OmniGraffle</span> menu.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">Select the <span class="UI">Use color profiles</span> checkbox to turn on OmniGraffle's ColorSync support. OmniGraffle will embed color profiles in the documents you save, and will try to read color profiles from the documents you open. A color profile helps ColorSync-compliant software and hardware display the document's colors accurately.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">You might receive documents saved with different color profiles than the one you are using. Use the pop-up menu to decide what OmniGraffle should do in such a situation. Select <span class="UI">Preserve original</span> to leave the color profile in the document as it is. Select <span class="UI">Convert automatically</span> to translate the color profile to match your own defaults. Select <span class="UI">Ask when opening</span> to have OmniGraffle present you with a choice each time you open a document with a different color profile.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="UI">Default Profiles</span> shows the color profiles you currently have set up in the system-wide ColorSync preferences. Click the button to open these preferences, where you can change these profiles to match your hardware. These profiles are the ones that will be embedded in documents you create.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">Note that you can manually set and convert color profiles from the <span class="UI">Format</span> menu, thereby overriding these defaults.</span>                        </div>

        <h2>Exporting <span class="Drop">to different formats</span></h2>
                        <div class="item "><span class="">You can create files of several different types from your OmniGraffle diagrams. Select <span class="UI">Export</span> from the <span class="UI">File</span> menu. When you export, a new file is written to the disk, leaving your original document as it is on the screen. Of course, not all aspects of a diagram can be represented in all file formats.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">The available file formats are:</span>                            <div class="item Pro"><span class=""><span class="UI">OmniGraffle document</span> — an OmniGraffle document. You can make the file read-only (not editable), and you can choose to include linked images in the file so that they show up properly on someone else's computer.</span>                            </div>
                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="UI">PDF vector image</span> — Portable Document Format. This is a nice cross-platform format that has good support for both vector components and bitmaps.</span>                            </div>
                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="UI">TIFF bitmap image</span> — Tagged Image File Format. This format supports transparency.</span>                            </div>
                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="UI">PNG bitmap image</span> — Portable Network Graphics, a popular format for the Web. This format uses lossless compression to retain the details of an image while decreasing its file size. It supports transparency.</span>                            </div>
                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="UI">JPEG bitmap image</span> — a popular compressed image format. You can lower the image quality to get a smaller file size.</span>                            </div>

(Note that actions on lines aren't included, but actions on <a href="help:anchor='linelabels' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">line labels</a> are)</span>                            </div>

This doesn't work as well for diagrams that don't have strictly tree-like structures.</span>                            </div>

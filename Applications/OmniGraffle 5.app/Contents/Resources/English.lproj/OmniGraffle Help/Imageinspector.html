        <h2><span class="Drop">Placing graphics inside a shape with the</span> Image inspector</h2>
                            <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/Image inspector.png" class="inline-image"></span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class=""> You can use this inspector to position an image inside a <a href="help:anchor='shape' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">shape</a>. (Note that instead of creating an object and then adding an image, you could also simply drag an image file from another application straight onto the canvas.)</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/dot1.png" class="inline-image"> Use the <span class="UI">Image</span> pop-up menu to set an image in the selected shape. Once an image is set, a <span class="UI">Remove Image</span> command appears in the menu.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">When you browse for an image file, you have the option of creating an alias (or &quot;link&quot;) to the image instead of adding the image to the OmniGraffle file itself. If you do this, the OmniGraffle document depends on the original image file; the alias will not work if you delete the image file or open the document on a different computer. If an object's image comes from an alias, some extra commands become available in the <span class="UI">Image</span> pop-up menu: you can <span class="UI">Open</span> the original image file, <span class="UI">Reveal</span> the original file in the Finder, or stop using the alias and <span class="UI">Embed</span> a copy of the image in the OmniGraffle document.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/dot2.png" class="inline-image"> Another way to set an image is just to drag an image file from another application and drop it on the <span class="Bold">image well</span>, or on the shape object itself.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/dot3.png" class="inline-image"> The first button displays the image at its <span class="Bold">natural</span> aspect ratio, with a zoom level and position as set with the controls below. The second button makes the image <span class="Bold">stretch</span> to fit inside the object. The third button makes the imae <span class="Bold">tile</span> indefinitely across the object.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/dot4.png" class="inline-image"> The <span class="Bold">positioning</span> offsets are enabled if you are displaying the image at its natural aspect ratio, as set by the first of the three buttons above. You can type a positive or negative percentage, or just drag the image around in the image well to indicate the area you want.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/dot5.png" class="inline-image"> The <span class="Bold">zoom</span> controls are available unless you are stretching the image to fit the shape. You can enter a zoom percentage, or just drag the slider, to make the image larger or smaller.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/dot6.png" class="inline-image"> You can make the image transparent and let the object's fill show through by decreasing the value of the <span class="Bold">opacity</span> field, or by dragging the opacity slider.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">You can also add an image to a canvas. Just click the canvas in the sidebar (so that it becomes highlighted in your selection color), then use the Image inspector normally.</span>                            </div>

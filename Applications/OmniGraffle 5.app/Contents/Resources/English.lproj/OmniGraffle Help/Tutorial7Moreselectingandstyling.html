        <h2>Tutorial 7: More selecting and styling</h2>
                            <div class="item "><span class="">Let's style the remaining objects. A quick way to select lots of shapes at once is with the Selection inspector, which is part of the Canvas inspector window. If you don't see it on your screen, select it from the <span class="UI">Inspectors</span> menu.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">The Selection inspector lists all of the different kinds of objects on the canvas, based on their styles. At the moment, it should show that you have one out of three colored rectangles selected. There should also be an item representing the four plain white rectangles with black strokes; click it to select all such objects at once, and it changes to show that you have selected four of four such objects.</span>                                <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/selection inspector.png" class="inline-image"></span>                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">You can use the Properties inspectors to change aspects of an object that are not strictly related to its visual style. We'll use the Geometry inspector to change the size of the four selected objects. If the Geometry inspector is not on your screen, select it from the <span class="UI">Inspectors</span> menu. In the width and height fields, enter some new values to make these shapes somewhat larger than the others.</span>                                <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/resized four objects.png" class="inline-image"></span>                                </div>
                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Use the Style inspectors to simultaneously style all four shapes in in a way that differentiates them from the others. Here we've chosen a different color, a slightly thicker stroke, and a larger font.</span>                                <div class="item "><span class=""><img src="../../HelpImages/styled all shapes.png" class="inline-image"></span>                                </div>
                            </div>

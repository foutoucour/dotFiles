        <h2><span class="Drop">Making objects interactive with the</span> Action inspector</h2>
                            <div class="item "><span class="">This inspector determines what should happen when someone clicks the selected object with the <a href="help:anchor='browsetool' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">Browse tool</a>.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">The default action is <span class="UI">Does Nothing</span>. You can click the object all you want, and nothing happens.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">If you choose <span class="UI">Opens a URL</span> or <span class="UI">Opens a file</span>, you get a text field and two buttons. You can type a URL or file path into the field, or drag a file to the panel, or click the <span class="UI">Choose File</span> button to browse your disks for a file. Note that file paths are relative: they start from the folder containing the document you're working on, not from the root of your hard drive. Click the <span class="UI">Open</span> button to try opening the file or URL in the field. When the object is clicked, the file or URL is opened.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">If you choose <span class="UI">Runs a script</span>, you get a text field for entering an AppleScript. The script that you enter is run such that &quot;self&quot; refers to the clicked object. Click the <span class="UI">Check Syntax</span> button to make sure that the AppleScript is correct, then click <span class="UI">Run Script</span> to try it out. When the object is clicked, the script runs.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">If you choose <span class="UI">Jumps elsewhere</span>, you get another pop-up menu for choosing where in the current document to jump. You can jump to a specific canvas, the next or previous canvas, or a specific point or object on any canvas. Some of these options offer a tiny canvas preview, in which you can click or drag to indicate which object to highlight, which point to center on, or where to zoom.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">If you choose <span class="UI">Shows or Hides Layers</span>, you can indicate whether to show, hide, or toggle the visibility of any layer of the current canvas.</span>                            </div>

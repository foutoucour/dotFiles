                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Bring to Front / Bring Forward</span> — Objects on the same <a href="help:anchor='layer' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">layer</a> have an order to them: newly created objects appear in front of objects that already existed. Choose <span class="UI">Bring to Front</span> to move the selected objects in front of all other objects on the layer. Hold Option to change this command to <span class="UI">Bring Forward</span>, which moves the selected objects forward one step in the ordering.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Send to Back / Send Backward</span> — This works like <span class="UI">Bring to Front</span>, except it moves the selected objects behind all other objects on the layer. Hold Option to change this command to <span class="UI">Send Backward</span>, which moves the selected objects backward one step in the ordering.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Lock</span> — Lock the selected objects. A locked object can't be moved or edited. When you try to select a locked object, it shows X marks instead of <a href="help:anchor='selectionhandles' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">selection handles</a>. Basically, the only thing you can do with a locked object is unlock it; the exception is that you can change an object's label and hierarchical position in the <a href="help:anchor='outlineview' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">outline view</a>. Locking is useful for making sure you don't accidentally change something you have set up just right.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Unlock</span> — Unlock the selected objects so that they can be moved or edited.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Group</span> — Use this command with at least two objects selected to turn them into a <a href="help:anchor='group' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">group</a>, making them behave like a single object.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Ungroup</span> — Use this command with a <a href="help:anchor='group' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">group</a> selected to separate it back into its component objects.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Make Table</span> — Use this command with one object selected to turn the object into a 1x1 <a href="help:anchor='table' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">table</a>, to which you can then add rows and columns.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Group as Subgraph</span> — Turn the selected objects into a self-contained <a href="help:anchor='subgraph' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">subgraph</a> that you can subsequently collapse to a single object.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Collapse Subgraph</span> — Change the selected <a href="help:anchor='subgraph' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">subgraph</a> into a single object, retaining all of the connection lines coming in or out of it.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Expand Subgraph</span> — Return a collapsed <a href="help:anchor='subgraph' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">subgraph</a> to its fully expanded majesty.</span>                            </div>

                                <div class="item Pro"><span class="">Manual guides are canvas-spanning magenta lines that you place yourself; you can make as many as you like, use them to align objects, and show or hide them from the <span class="UI">View</span> menu.</span>                                </div>
                                <div class="item "><span class=""><span class="Bold">Enable/Disable Smart Alignment Guides —</span> These are the smart guides that appear to help you line up objects' edges or centers.

You can also drag new guides out from the vertical and horizontal <a href="help:anchor='rulers' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">rulers</a>.</span>                                </div>

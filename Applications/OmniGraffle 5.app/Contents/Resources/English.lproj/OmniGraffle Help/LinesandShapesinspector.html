When it is selected, controls become available for changing the appearance of the stroke.</span>                            </div>

The center pop-up menu determines how the stroke appears at its ends: The <span class="UI">Butt</span> option ends the line by cutting across its endpoint at an angle perpendicular to the line itself, while the <span class="UI">Round</span> and <span class="UI">Square</span> options let the line extend past its endpoint based on the stroke width. The third pop-up menu determines how the stroke appears at its corners: <span class="UI">Miter</span> creates a sharp corner, <span class="UI">Round</span> creates a soft corner, and <span class="UI">Bevel</span> creates a cut-off corner.</span>                            </div>

Use the tail and head menus to set the line endings. Use the middle menu to set how the line travels from its source to its destination: <span class="UI">Straight</span> for a line that takes the shortest possible path between points, <span class="UI">Curved</span> for a line that turns smoothly to pass through each point, <span class="UI">Orthogonal</span> for a line that always travels horizontally or vertically, or <span class="UI">Bezier</span> for a line with control points you can adjust with the <a href="help:anchor='selectiontool' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">selection tool</a>.</span>                                </div>

The hops depend on the ordering of the lines involved; you can reorder objects with the <span class="UI">Bring</span> and <span class="UI">Send</span> commands in the <span class="UI">Arrange</span> menu.</span>                                </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">You can also edit the stroke of a canvas itself. Just click the canvas in the sidebar (so that it becomes highlighted in your selection color), then use the enabled controls in the Stroke inspector.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Once objects are connected by a line, they stay connected no matter how much you change them or move them around. That means the logical integrity of your diagram is preserved regardless of how you choose to style it. You can disconnect a line from an object by selecting the line and then dragging one of its endpoints.</span>                            </div>

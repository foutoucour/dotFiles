        <h2><span class="Drop">Using the</span> outline sidebar <span class="Drop">to edit a hierarchical diagram</span></h2>
                        <div class="item "><span class="">The outline sidebar gives you a quick way to enter lots of data, and an alternate way to look at hierarchical diagrams. To see it, choose <span class="UI">Outline</span> from the <span class="UI">View</span> menu. If you have the <a href="help:anchor='listsidebar' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">list sidebar</a> open, you can also click the button at the top of it to switch to the outline sidebar.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">The outline shows any <a href="help:anchor='shapes' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">shapes</a> you've created on the canvas, arranged hierarchically according to the <a href="help:anchor='lines' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">lines</a> that connect them. Likewise, as you enter text into the outline, shapes are automatically created and connected on the canvas with corresponding text.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">To start working in the outline, just click an existing item, or double-click in an empty area to create a new item. While you work in the outline view, the following keys can be used to create and arrange items:</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item Box">                            <div class="item "><span class="">Press Return to create a &quot;peer&quot; of the currently selected item. Peers appear on the same indentation level in the outline, and, if they are beyond the top level, have connections from the same parent object in the diagram.</span>                            </div>
                            <div class="item "><span class="">Press Tab to indent the currently selected item, making it a &quot;child&quot; of the item above it in the outline. A connection line is drawn in the diagram from the parent object to the child object.</span>                            </div>
                            <div class="item "><span class="">Press Shift-Tab to outdent the currently selected item, making it a peer of what used to be its parent.</span>                            </div>
                            <div class="item "><span class="">Press Escape to switch between selecting an item and editing the item's text.</span>                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">There are also keyboard shortcuts especially for quickly building outlines. Check the <span class="UI">Keyboard Shortcuts</span> file in the <span class="UI">Help</span> menu for details.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">An item can be dragged around the outline view by its <span class="Bold">handle</span>, the dot or triangle to the left of each item. Dragging an item with children brings its children with it. While you drag an item, a black line appears to show the location and indentation level the item will have when you drop it.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">A <a href="help:anchor='group' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">group</a>, <a href="help:anchor='table' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">table</a>, or <a href="help:anchor='subgraph' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">subgraph</a> on the canvas is shown as a single item in the outline, surrounded by brackets. Click the arrows on the right side of the item to see the objects inside and edit their text.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">The Action pop-up menu below the outline sidebar offers quick access to commands in the <span class="UI">Outlining</span> submenu of the <span class="UI">Edit</span> menu, as well as commands to manage <a href="help:anchor='diagramstyles' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">diagram styles</a>.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">If you have chosen a diagram style for the canvas, objects in the diagram are created to match the diagram style. A preview of the selected diagram style appears above the pop-up menu. If you change the diagram style, objects already on the canvas change to match the new style, unless they have been styled manually. You can force manually styled objects to conform to the diagram style by selecting them and using the command <span class="UI">Format ‣ Restyle Selected Objects</span>, or you can force all objects on the canvas to conform by choosing <span class="UI">Format ‣ Reapply Diagram Style</span>.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">While the outline view is handy for entering lots of information quickly, an outline can't always perfectly represent the relationships in a complicated diagram. Objects with more than one parent, lines connected to other lines, and circular ancestry (&quot;I'm my own grandpa!&quot;) are all examples of the kinds of things a simple outline can't properly show. In these cases, the outline view tries its best to be accurate. If your diagram is not strictly tree-like, you should probably not rely on the outline view very much.</span>                        </div>

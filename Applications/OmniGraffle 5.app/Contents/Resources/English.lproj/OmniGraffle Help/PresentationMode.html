        <h2>Presentation Mode</h2>
                        <div class="item "><span class="">Presentation mode is available from the <span class="UI">View</span> menu; it fills the entire screen with your document so that you can easily present it to others.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">Each <a href="help:anchor='canvas' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">canvas</a> acts as a slide; use the arrow keys to move between canvases. You can also press Return or Enter, or click, to move to the next canvas. If your Presentation preferences are set to highlight an object when you click it, doing so won't advance to the next canvas; you can still click an empty area of the canvas to advance. If you move the mouse cursor to the bottom of the screen, a navigation interface appears, with buttons for going forward or back, exiting, or moving directly to a particular canvas.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">You can highlight objects to draw attention to them during the presentation. Use the Presentation preferences to control how highlighting happens.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">To leave presentation mode, press Escape or click the X button that appears when you move the mouse pointer to the bottom of the screen.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">Actions set up in the <a href="help:anchor='actioninspector' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">Action inspector</a> work while in presentation mode. When you click an object that has an action assigned, it performs the action as if you had clicked it with the <a href="help:anchor='browsetool' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">Browse tool</a>.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">Presentation preferences</span>                            <div class="item "><span class="">In presentation mode, you can highlight objects on the canvas.</span>                            </div>
                            <div class="item "><span class="">Choose whether to have an object become highlighted whenever you put the pointer on it, whenever you click it, or never. You can also choose to display a badge for objects that have actions set up in the <a href="help:anchor='actioninspector' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">Action inspector</a>.</span>                            </div>
                            <div class="item "><span class="">Click the color well to choose a color for the highlight. One good trick is to use <span class="Verbatim">selectedControlColor</span> from the Developer palette; this color always matches the highlight color selected in Mac OS X's Appearance preferences. Use the slider to control the thickness of the highlight.</span>                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <div class="item "><span class="">If you have more than one window open, the frontmost window is used for the presentation. If you have two displays, you can put the presentation on one screen while editing the document on the other.</span>                        </div>

                        <div class="item Box">                            <div class="item "><span class="">Select <span class="UI">New Window on &quot;Document&quot;</span> (where <span class="UI">Document</span> is your document title) from the <span class="UI">Window</span> menu.</span>                            </div>
                            <div class="item "><span class="">Drag one window to the second display.</span>                            </div>
                            <div class="item "><span class="">Click the window on the second display to make sure it is frontmost.</span>                            </div>
                            <div class="item "><span class="">Enter presentation mode. The second display shows the presentation while your first display keeps its normal document window.</span>                            </div>
                            <div class="item "><span class="">Now you can edit the document on the first display and the presentation on the second display updates itself.</span>                            </div>

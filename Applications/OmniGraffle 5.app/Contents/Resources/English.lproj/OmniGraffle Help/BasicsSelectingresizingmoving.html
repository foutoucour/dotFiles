                            <div class="item "><span class="">To select an object, first make sure you are using the <a href="help:anchor='selectiontool' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">Selection tool</a> (<img src="../../HelpImages/Selection Tool.png" class="inline-image">), then click the object. The object is highlighted, and if it can be resized, eight handles appear on its edges and corners. Once you have selected an object you can modify it with the <a href="help:anchor='inspectors' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">inspectors</a> or perform menu commands on it.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">To select or deselect more objects without losing the selection you already have, hold Command as you click them.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">To select several adjacent objects at once, click in an empty area of the canvas and drag a box around the objects you would like to select. If you hold Option while dragging, you'll get only the objects that fit completely inside the rectangle.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">To resize an object, first select it. Then drag one of its resize handles (the tiny squares that appear when an object is selected) until the object is the right size. <a href="help:anchor='smartguides' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">Smart guides</a> appear to help you size objects uniformly.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">To move an object, use the Selection tool to click and hold on the object, then drag it to its new location. <a href="help:anchor='smartguides' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">Smart guides</a> appear to help you align objects to one another.</span>                            </div>

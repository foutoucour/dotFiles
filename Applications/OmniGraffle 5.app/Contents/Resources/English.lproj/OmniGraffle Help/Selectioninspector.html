<a name="selectioninspector"></a>
        <h2><span class="Drop">Finding objects with the</span> Selection inspector</h2>
                            <div class="item "><span class="">This inspector contains representations of all the different styles of objects on the canvas.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Each style of object has a representation of the object and a pair of numbers. The first number is how many objects you have selected which match that style; the second number is how many objects of that style exist on the canvas.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Click a box to select all objects that match it. You can then use the Style and Properties <a href="help:anchor='inspectors' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">inspectors</a> to modify the objects on the canvas as if you'd clicked them individually. This is convenient if you'd like to, for example, change all blue diamonds to pink hearts.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">You can also drop a style chit from the <a href="help:anchor='styletray' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">style tray</a> onto a box in this inspector to apply the style to all associated objects.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">The <span class="UI">Filter</span> pop-up menu contains style attributes that you can use to differentiate types of objects from one another. For instance, if you want objects with different fills to be considered different types, but you don't care about whether their strokes are different, select <span class="UI">Fill</span> and deselect <span class="UI">Stroke</span>.</span>                            </div>

                            <div class="item "><span class="">Type in the <span class="Bold">Search field</span> to select objects whose text, <a href="help:anchor='note' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">note</a>, or <a href="help:anchor='customdata' bookID='OmniGraffle Help'">custom data</a> match a certain word or phrase. As you type, objects become selected or deselected depending on whether they match. The magnifying glass pop-up menu stores your most recent searches.</span>                            </div>

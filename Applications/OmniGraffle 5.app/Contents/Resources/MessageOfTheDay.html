		<span class="day">5.4 - May 24, 2012</span>
		<span class="content">
			<ul><li>Changes for OmniGraffle 5.4<ul>
				<li>New Features<ul>
				<li>64-bit mode: If you're running Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard) or Mac OS X 10.7 (Lion), OmniGraffle now takes advantage of 64-bit mode, providing substantial stability and performance improvements. <b>This has changed the minimum Operating System Requirement to Mac OS X 10.6 or later.</b></li>
				<li>A dynamic Quick Look preview generator has been added to OmniGraffle, which brings back the ability to Quick Look files in the Finder while no longer writing out the preview to the file (impacting performance when autosaving and versioning).</li>
				<li>Stencil searching has been greatly improved to help you find stencils or objects in stencils that you have installed.</li>
				<li>Shadows have improved their rendering, particularly when zoomed in.</li>
				<li>Keyboard shortcuts for Zoom In and Zoom Out have been changed to match the iWork applications.</li>
				<li>When OmniGraffle is unlicensed, the right side of the document titlebar should indicate that it is in trial mode, and how many days are left in the trial.</li>
				<li>OmniGraffle now sports a new icon to bring it more into the family of our other applications.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Bug Fixes<ul>
				<li>Fixed a bug where overlapping orthogonal lines snapping to magnets could render one or more of the lines unselectable.</li>
				<li>When dragging an image from a web browser to a canvas, the image should now land under the mouse cursor and not off the canvas to the lower left corner.</li>
				<li>Fixed a bug when editing text and clicking on the canvas that would make a jump to the wrong spot if the canvas is auto-resizing.</li>
				<li>Fixed a bug where "Revert Document" in the File Menu was unavailable after switching to another application in Mac OS X 10.7.</li>
				<li>Duplicating a file in Mac OS X 10.7 now properly cascades the window position.</li>
				<li>The "Duplicate" entry in the Edit Menu has now been changed to "Duplicate Selection" in order to cease confusion with the Duplicate entry in the File Menu.</li>
				<li>Fixed a severe performance issue having to do with a large number of text variables on a particular canvas.</li>
				<li>Addressed an issue where the Stencil Window search could recognize certain files that are not stencils based on their file extension.</li>
				<li>The Open ColorSync Utility button in the ColorSync preference pane should now be working again.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Crashes<ul>
				<li>Fixed a prevalent crash when dragging color swatches from the Color Picker.</li>
				<li>Fixed a crash when exporting a document with many canvases with shared layers to file formats that write out multiple files for each canvas.</li>
				<li>Fixed a crash when reverting to a previous version of the document for certain files while running in Mac OS X 10.7.</li>
				<li>As noted above, 64-bit mode offers increased stability and neatly avoids a number of existing reported crashes in the reproducible test cases we have found.</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				</ul>
				</li>
				</ul>
                </span>

		<span class="content">
			<ul><li>Changes for OmniGraffle 5.3.6<ul>
				<li>Fixed a regression where drop shadows on objects would not print.</li>
				<le>Fixed a bug where shadows were not rendering properly for Mac OS X v10.5 users.</li>
				<li>Found a few more cases where dragging a raster image to a pixel-based canvas would place the image on non-integral pixel coordinates.</li>
				<li>The title of the Stencil Window should now again be localized.</li>
				<li>Addressed an issue that would generate errant vertex points when using the Pen Tool.</li>
			</ul>
			</li></ul>
                </span>

		<span class="day">5.3.5 - October 18, 2011</span>

			<ul><li>Changes for OmniGraffle 5.3.5<ul>

			<li>Fixed a bug where the Stencil Window would show on launch whether it had been showing previously or not.</li>
			<li>Dragging images to a pixel based canvas with a pixel grid on should now place the image on integral pixel coordinates.</li>
			<li>When exporting a multiple canvas document that's not using printer sheets for its canvas sizing and canvas size auto-adjustment is on, export areas will fit the content on each canvas appropriately.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug where drop shadows on canvas name variables on shared layers was showing the incorrect canvas name.</li>
			<li>Fixed another bug having to do with zooming on auto-resizing canvases.</li>
			</ul>
			</li></ul>
                </span>

			</ul>
			</li></ul>
                </span>

		<span class="day">5.3.3 - September 21, 2011</span>
		<span class="content">
			<ul><li>Changes for OmniGraffle 5.3.3<ul>
			<li>Quick Look previews have been temporarily disabled on Lion while we work out some performance issues which made Auto Save too slow when working with complex documents. (This made the app hang every time you switched away and back.) We plan to bring back Quick Look previews in our next update (after addressing these performance issues).</li>
			<li>Automatic canvas size adjustments now give a bit more padding between the object and the canvas edge.</li>
			<li>Canvases that are set to auto-adjust and are not sized using printer pages will now automatically grow when the window is resized, making for an 'infinite canvas' of sorts.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug where Option-dragging objects from one layer to another in the Layer List sidebar would move objects to the wrong layer.</li>
			<li>Aliases and Symlinks residing in the proper directory that point to folders containing stencils should now show up in the Stencil Window.</li>
			<li>Addressed an NSDocumentController error when opening the Template Chooser.</li>
			<li>Fixed a crash when dragging certain groups that contain both shapes and lines.</li>

			<li>Addressed an issue where existing favorite stencils went missing.</li>
			<li>Fixed a bug where we now ensure that there's PNG data on the pasteboard, particularly in Mac OS X v10.5.</li>
			<li>When saving a version of a duplicated file when running Mac OS X v10.7, the "dirty" close button should go away.</li>
			<li>Universal Access on Mac OS X v10.7 has taken our existing keyboard shortcut for "Snap to Grid", this shortcut has been removed from OmniGraffle; it can be customized in System Preferences.</li>
